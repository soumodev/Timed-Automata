# Timed-Automata
## Computing Accumulated Delays in Real-Time Systems - A Summary

The objective of the paper is to find an optimal PSPACE verification algorithm for duration
bounded reachability problem of real time systems. The paper uses Timed Automata to model
real-time systems.

The duration bounded reachability problem w.r.t. timed automata is the question whether
there exists a run of the automaton starting from an initial state to a final state whose duration
satisfies an arithmetic constraint.

The duration of a run can be seen as a linear combination of the timed spent in each state visited
through the run.
